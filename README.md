# Solving-Tower-of-Hanoi-in-PDDL

hanoi.py is the python script (main file). Run it with: 

python hanoi.py --disks <number of disks> 

If omitted, the number of disks defaults to 3.
  
It will create a domain PDDL file, problem PDDL file and then run them and output it to a file "sas_plan".
  
  
The folder "Three Disks" contains the generated files by running "python hanoi.py"
